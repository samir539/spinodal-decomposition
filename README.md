# spinodal-decomposition
This project aims to solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation for a range of conditions to see the impact of the initial composition on spinodal decomposition.

Overview : The project looks to model the process of spinodal decomposition where we observe a spontaneous phase seperation occuring in a homogenous superstaured solution.
